forgot password, when new registration is done mail to that email id with username and password

filter by name or anything
search option working

status wise viewing option for tasks.

today and next 7 days working
maybe i am thinking remove the today and next 7days and add one thing a filter page,
         in that you can filter by deadline (today, next 7 days, this month) and status, deadline

add a completed section below filterpage in that completed page completed tasks should appear

notifications for today deadline tasks and high priority tasks and if manager makes any changes in teamtasks he should be notified

team tasks update delete operations by manager and popup for double click on teamtasks in that all data should be viewed
